## Overview
To view the app just download and install. A few things to keep in mind.

1. Based on the canvasUnits (16 total) that come back, some tiles are
very small (3x3 units) or very wide (14x4). Because of this, I created 3 different layouts to be used.
These layouts also either 1) shrink the image and or the pricing text or 2) remove certain elements from
the tile to scale safely and degrade gracefully.
